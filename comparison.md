# Comparison of Covid-19 between Malaysia and Other Countries

Source: Johns Hopkins CSSE [Data Repository](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19)

Three types of graph are plotted:
1. **Total confirmed Covid-19 Cases againt time** and normalized.
2. **Daily new Covid-19 against time** and normalized.
3. **New confirmed cases in the past week against total confirmed cases** in logarithmic scale to represent the trajectory of Covid-19 cases in respective country. The exponential growth of total confirmed cases agaisnt time is represented as a straight upward lines in this way. Most of the countries are following the same trajectory in the beginning of the outbreak in each country and bend downwards when they have successfully contained the virus.

## Compare to Global Key Countries
China and South Korea are selected as they have sucessfully surpressed the virus from spreading, while Italy is selected because it has almost the same outbreak time as Malaysia and US which is having the most cases currently.

**Normalised**

The cases of US, China and Italy have outnumbered the cases in Malaysia and South Korea. Thus, the visualisation of Malaysia and South Korea cases are not clear and it is better to be compared after normalisation.

After nomalisation, it can be noticed that the trajectory of China and South Korea have went from exponential to logarithmic form in the middle of February and in the beginning of March respectively which have reached the peak of daily new cases, the turning points. For Italy, it has almost the same outbreak time as Malaysia and both are now trying to seek turning points. This can be seen in the second plot that both countries are slowing down in reported daily cases after effective movement control measuremnet but is still not sure whether the peaks are reached. Lastly, US is still at the beginning of the outbreak as we can see the exponential line in the plot of total confirmed cases against time as they are having increasing daily new cases.

Besides, it is interesting to mention that South Korea has successfully contained the virus without major movement restriction control on citizens. This is due to their capability to carry out around 15000 tests per day while Malaysia is around 2000 per day. The earlier the patients are tested positively, the faster the authority could do contact tracing in order to contain the virus effectively. A separated analysis about comparison of testing capability and how it affects the spreading of virus between Malaysia and Korea will be done.

From the plot above, all the countries are having the same trajectory line in the beginning. After success in China and South Korea, their trajectory is heading downwards with gradually decreasing daily new confirmed cases while US is still heading upward as a straight slope line. Italy and Malaysia have seen to be moving away from the trend but still not dropping.

## Compare to Neighbour Countries

Singapore and Thailand are selected as there are frequenct travellers in land borders connecting to Malaysia.

**Normalised**

Malaysia is leading and followed by Thailand and Singapore. In normalised graph, these countries are having exponentially rise in the mid of March and they are having almost the same trend lately to seek turning points as daily new cases are slowing down from increasing. The slowing down trend could be seen clearly in the trajectory plot below. They are bending away from the straight upward slope line and seek to drop in the near future after effective movement restriction control.
